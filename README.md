\# Customer Churn Prediction

Predict customer churn using machine learning to help businesses retain at-risk customers.



\## Overview

This project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset to predict whether customers will leave a telecommunications company. The workflow demonstrates a full data science pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.



Key steps include:



\- Data loading and cleaning

\- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization

\- Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables

\- Training and evaluating a Random Forest classifier

\- Visualizing feature importance and model performance metrics



The notebook and results are designed to provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.

\## Key Steps Performed



1\. \*\*Data Preprocessing\*\*

&nbsp;  - Encoded categorical features and handled missing values

&nbsp;  - Scaled numeric features if required



2\. \*\*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\*\*

&nbsp;  - Visualized distributions of numeric and categorical features

&nbsp;  - Analyzed target variable distribution



3\. \*\*Model Training\*\*

&nbsp;  - Trained a Random Forest classifier for churn prediction

&nbsp;  - Performed train-test split and handled class imbalance



4\. \*\*Model Evaluation\*\*

&nbsp;  - Confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC metrics

&nbsp;  - Feature importance analysis to identify key churn drivers

\## Results Summary

\- The Random Forest classifier successfully identifies customers likely to churn.  

\- Important features include tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and payment method.  

\- Visualizations provide insights into customer behavior and inform retention strategies.

\## Future Work

\- Experiment with additional models (XGBoost, Logistic Regression)  

\- Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance  

\- Deploy a real-time predictive dashboard for business use
